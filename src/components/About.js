            I'm a Tech lead and Product Manager based in Graz, Austria. After completing my studies at Graz University of Technology,
            I had the opportunity to work in different fields as a software engineer, architect and product owner.
            While I am fascinated by the wide range of possibilities in software engineering, I am particularly interested in web development and data analytics.

            In my free time, I enjoy climbing, hiking, running, or playing a game of chess. Over the past few years,
            sport climbing has become one of my biggest passions, and I now teach climbing at
            the <a href="https://www.c-a-c.at/">city adventure center</a> in Graz.

            Currently, I work as a Tech Lead and Product Manager, combining technical expertise with a strong focus on leadership.
            While my role involves now more strategic thinking, mentoring and team coordination, I still enjoy building features,
            fixing bugs, and creating solutions for exciting problems.
