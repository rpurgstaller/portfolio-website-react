        <h1>Hey there, I'm Roman</h1>
        <p>
          I'm a Tech lead and Product Manager based in Graz, Austria. After finishing my studies at Graz University of Technology,
          I had the opportunity to work in different fields as a software engineer, architect and product owner.
          While I am fascinated with the variety of possibilities in software engineering, I especially have a strong personal interest in web development and data analytics.

          When I'm not coding, I'm propably climbing, hiking, on a run or play a game of chess. Since Sports climbing
          became one of my biggest passions the last few years, I also give courses as a sports climbing instructor at
          the <a href="https://www.c-a-c.at/">city adventure center</a> in Graz.
        </p>

          Currently, I work as a tech lead and product manager, combining my technical expertise with my passion for leadership.
          While my work now involves more strategic thinking, leadership and mentoring, I still enjoy building features, fixing bugs or creating solutions for exciting problems.
