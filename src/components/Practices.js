        Practices (wip)

        <p>
          Having worked as a developer, product owner, tech lead, and product manager for over a decade, I've collaborated
          with diverse teams and experienced a variety of working styles. Along the way, I've had the privilege of
          meeting many talented and inspiring people who have enriched both my professional and personal life.
        </p>
        <p>
          What consistently stood out to me is that the teams who deliver high-quality software, have an open mind,
          embrace new challenges, and maintain a mindset of continuous learning. To me, this is how great teams scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          I strive to embody these habits and values in my daily work. Below is a selection of practices I try to follow.
