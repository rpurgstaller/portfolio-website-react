# Getting Started with Create React App

Thanks for your interest in my website!

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
For deployment, [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) was used. 

You can find the live version of the website [here](https://www.rpurgstaller.app).

Feel free to copy and reuse anything in this repository. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
